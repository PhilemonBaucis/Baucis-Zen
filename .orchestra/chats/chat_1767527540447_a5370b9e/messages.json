Here's what I found:\n\n- **No `.git` directory** - The project is not initialized as a git repository\n- **No remote URL configured** - There's no origin/upstream connection to GitHub\n- **No `deployments.json`** file with repo information\n\nThis appears to be a local project (\"Baucis Zen\") that was scaffolded but never pushed to GitHub.\n\n**To create a GitHub repo for this project:**\n\n1. Initialize git: `git init`\n2. Create a repo on GitHub (via web or `gh repo create`)\n3. Add the remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/baucis-zen.git`\n4. Commit and push: `git add . && git commit -m \"Initial commit\" && git push -u origin main`\n\nWould you like me to help set up a GitHub repository for this project?",
